I am a Phd Candidate at Northeastern University in Boston, where I work with <a href="https://cbw.sh/">Christo Wilson</a>. My research interests are in web privacy and security, web fingerprinting, and internet measurement. Moreover, I am also working as a part-time Privacy Software Engineer at <a href="https://nationalinternetobservatory.org/">National Internet Observatory</a>. My goal is to make the internet a more private and secure place.
