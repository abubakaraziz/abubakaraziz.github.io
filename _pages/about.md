I am a Phd Candidate at Northeastern University in Boston, where I work with <a href="https://cbw.sh/">Christo Wilson</a>. My research interests are in web privacy and security, and internet measurement. Moreover, in my current project, I am also collaborating with <a href="https://nationalinternetobservatory.org/">National Internet Observatory</a> to analyze the adoption of Google's Privacy Sandbox API. My goal is to make the internet a more private and secure place.
