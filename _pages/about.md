I am a Phd Candidate at Northeastern University in Boston, where I work with <a href="https://cbw.sh/">Christo Wilson</a>. My research interests are in web privacy and security, web fingerprinting, and internet measurement. Moreover, I am also working as a part-time Privacy Software Engineer at <a href="https://nationalinternetobservatory.org/">National Internet Observatory</a>. My goal is to make the internet a more private and secure place.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
